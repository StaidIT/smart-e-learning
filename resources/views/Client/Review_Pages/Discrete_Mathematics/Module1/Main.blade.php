            Discrete Mathematics is the study of mathematical structures that
            are distinct and countable. It focuses on objects such as sets,

            {{$module->module_name}} Summary
        </h2>

        <p class="text-gray-400 mt-3 leading-relaxed">
            In this module, we introduced the fundamental concepts of
            Discrete Mathematics and explored how mathematical reasoning
            can be applied to problems in mathematics and information
            technology.
        </p>

        <p class="text-gray-400 mt-3 leading-relaxed">
            We first discussed <span class="text-white">Logic</span>,
            including propositions, logical connectives, compound
            propositions, truth tables, tautologies, contradictions,
            propositional equivalence, and rules of inference. These
            concepts provide a foundation for expressing and evaluating
            logical statements.
        </p>

        <p class="text-gray-400 mt-3 leading-relaxed">
            We then studied <span class="text-white">Sets and Set
            Operations</span>. A set is a well-defined collection of
            distinct objects. We explored different types of sets,
            membership, subsets, and operations such as union,
            intersection, difference, and complement.
        </p>

        <p class="text-gray-400 mt-3 leading-relaxed">
            Finally, we examined the <span class="text-white">Properties
            of Sets</span>, including the commutative, associative,
            distributive, identity, complement, idempotent, domination,
            double complement, absorption, and De Morgan's properties.
            These rules allow set expressions to be simplified,
            transformed, and compared without changing their meaning.
        </p>

        <p class="text-gray-400 mt-3 leading-relaxed">
            Understanding logic, sets, set operations, and their
            properties provides an important foundation for later topics
            in Discrete Mathematics and their applications in information
            technology, including databases, programming, data
            organization, and problem solving.

                    Propositions can be combined using logical
